On Plotino there is a minerary outpost: The Station, your life mostly take places inside it's metal and glass walls.

Outside The Station, the endless darkness presses against thick reinforced glass, occasionally pierced by flashes of distant stars.

	Environment: Cold, dark, and perpetually dusty. Limited access to natural light and fresh air."
